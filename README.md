# College and University tasks and assessments 2014-2017
- this repository contains files which I was able to gather up from my private archives to document the progress made in the last 3 years
- it might be possible that some of the earlier files contain inappropriate class, method or variable name declarations, the structure was not well visible or overcomplicated but I think it is worth to keep it like that to have a reminder of lessons learned as I think that I've made a large progress in the last few years and try to improve my style with each written code.
- College code was written using NetBeans and University code was made with use of the Eclipse Neon
- whereas folder was named "practical" I don't claim full ownership of included code as it was based on lecture and practical sample code, and later built upon it
